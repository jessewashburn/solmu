# Classical Guitar Music Database - Project Roadmap

---

## Project Overview

A public, searchable classical guitar database built to preserve and share classical guitar repertoire. The platform aggregates data from Sheerpluck and IMSLP, provides clean search capabilities, and allows staff curation through an admin portal.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React (GitHub Pages)
- **Backend**: Python + Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Admin**: Django Admin with custom permissions
- **Hosting**: Django on cloud platform + PostgreSQL (Supabase) + HTTPS
